			<h1>Game world</h1>
			<p>All the action of the game takes place in the city of Rockport, which contains 3 main areas</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Rosewood (eng. Rosewood) - This area, immersed in the autumn yellowness of the hills, is the educational and entertainment center of Rockport. There is a university campus in the center, with a park adjoining from the northern part, smoothly turning into a golf course. There is a baseball stadium to the west of the campus. The southern part of Rosewood is occupied by a residential area, entangled in a network of roads and alleys. This location is ringed by a high-speed highway, from which numerous winding roads stretch to the center, providing an opportunity to quickly move to the desired place. Available from the very beginning of the game.</p></li>
				<li><p>Camden Beach is an area of fishing huts (North Gray Point), a network of tourist attractions (Ocean Hills), and industrial zones (Point Camden, South Gray Point). This area has the largest number of treacherous forks, cuts, elevation changes and other surprises. The most interesting are the docks, which are located in the southern part of the region: there are just a lot of all kinds of nooks and jumps, made up of parts of ships. Unlocked when a player beats # 13 on the Blacklist (Vic).</p></li>
				<li><p>Downtown Rockport is the business center of the city with offices, banks, factories, huge skyscrapers and many construction sites. Unlocked when a player beats # 9 on the Blacklist (Earl).</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h1>Characters</h1>
			<p>In addition to the main character - the protagonist of the game, Need for Speed: Most Wanted features characters who meet in the game's plot and help or harm the hero. Real actors took part in the filming of the video screensavers of the game, which was fixed in the subsequent parts of the Need for Speed series.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Mia Townsend is an acquaintance of Raizor and a friend of the protagonist, who helps him throughout the game, and also opposes Raizor because of an unfair race with the protagonist. At the end of the game, he surrenders Razor to the police, arranges for the hero to escape from the city, and, as it turns out, is an undercover policeman. Drives a Mazda RX-8 [К 4].</p></li>
				<li><p>Clarence Callahan, better known as Razor, is the main antagonist of the game. At first he was # 15 on the Black List, but in the race with the main character at the beginning of the plot he framed him, thanks to which he took his car and climbed to the first place in the Black List. At the end of the game, he was defeated by the main character and arrested by the police. At the beginning of the game he drives a Ford Mustang GT, and after "defeating" the hero - a BMW M3 GTR.</p></li>
				<li><p>Cross is a Rockport police sergeant who drives with his assistant. At the beginning of the game, he arrests the protagonist, who was later released for lack of evidence. At the end of the game, he summons all the Rockport police squads in pursuit of the hero and loses his position as a police sergeant. Drives a Chevrolet Corvette C6.R [K 5].</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h1>Story</h1>
			<p>The protagonist arrives in Rockport in his BMW M3 GTR in search of rivals for racing. [20] The city police do not like racers very much and fights them especially hard. She keeps statistics in accordance with the information on the number of persecutions and the damage caused. The so-called "Blacklist" of fifteen riders who are the most wanted in Rockport has been determined. Among the city's racers it is considered very prestigious to get on this list. Driving around the city, the hero stumbles upon Ronnie McCree, wins a race from him and then follows him to a party of local illegal racers. The local crowd greeted the newcomer with dissatisfaction. The hero races and wins. When it's time to race with Razor, # 15 on the Blacklist, Razor adjusts the breakdown so that in the middle of the race, the hero starts to leak oil, and as a result, with a strong grinding and rumble in the engine, he stops before the finish, losing the race. The expulsion of the hero from the city by a gang of illegal racers was prevented by unexpectedly arriving policemen. Razor takes the BMW and takes off to the top of the list thanks to the protagonist's car, which was detained by Sergeant Cross and his assistant. But soon after, Mia, an acquaintance of Razor's, dissatisfied with how dishonest he had done to the newcomer, takes the hero, released from prison for lack of evidence, to the center of Rosewood, providing him with a garage.</p>
			
			<p>The main character begins to slowly but surely move up the "Black List", gaining authority and attracting the attention of the city police. In this he is assisted by both Mia and the illegal racer Rog, his old friend, giving useful advice as his career progresses. After the hero, participating in the race with the antagonist Razor, wins, he is very determined and aggressive, and is not going to give up the car. A gang of already defeated street racers support him, ready to use force, but then Mia appears, arrests Razor and stops the gang that attacked her, showing a holster with a pistol hidden in his clothes. It is thus revealed that Mia is actually an undercover police officer. She hands Raizor to the arriving police, but before they arrive, she throws the BMW keys to the protagonist. Cross sends all the Rockport Police Force (Level 6 Police) to chase him. It is impossible to hide in usual shelters, since the police controlled all the safe places of the street racers. After five minutes of pursuit, Mia calls to inform her that the only way to get away from the pursuit is to drive along the initially closed road and, after accelerating, fly over the unfinished bridge and get out of the city.</p>
