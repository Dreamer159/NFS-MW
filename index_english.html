			<p>	Need for Speed: Most Wanted is a Need for Speed arcade car racing video game developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts for consoles, personal computers and mobile phones in 2005. The release of the game was timed to coincide with the start of sales of the new Xbox 360 console, a disc with the game was supplied with the console. In Russia, Most Wanted was published by the Soft Club company, initially with Russian documentation, and since 2006 - completely in Russian. A PlayStation Portable version of the game was released as Need for Speed: Most Wanted 5-1-0</p>

			<p>	The protagonist arrives in Rockport in his BMW M3 GTR in search of rivals to race. The city police do not like racers very much and fights them especially hard. She keeps statistics in accordance with the information on the number of persecutions and the damage caused. The so-called "Blacklist" of fifteen riders who are the most wanted in Rockport has been determined. Among the city's racers it is considered very prestigious to get on this list. Driving around the city, the hero stumbles upon Ronnie McCree, wins a race from him and then follows him to a party of local illegal racers. The local crowd greeted the newcomer with dissatisfaction. The hero races and wins. When it's time to race with Razor, # 15 on the Blacklist, Razor adjusts the breakdown so that in the middle of the race, the hero starts to leak oil, and as a result, with a strong grinding and rumble in the engine, he stops before the finish, losing the race. The expulsion of the hero from the city by a gang of illegal racers was prevented by unexpectedly arriving policemen. Razor takes the BMW and takes off to the top of the list thanks to the protagonist's car, which was detained by Sergeant Cross and his assistant. But soon after, Mia, an acquaintance of Razor's, dissatisfied with how dishonest he had done to the newcomer, takes the hero, released from prison for lack of evidence, to the center of Rosewood, providing him with a garage.</p>

			<p>	The main character begins to slowly but surely move up the "Black List", gaining authority and attracting the attention of the city police. In this he is assisted by both Mia and the illegal racer Rog, his old friend, giving useful advice as his career progresses. After the hero, participating in the race with the antagonist Razor, wins, he is very determined and aggressive, and is not going to give up the car. A gang of already defeated street racers support him, ready to use force, but then Mia appears, arrests Razor and stops the gang that attacked her, showing a holster with a pistol hidden in his clothes. It is thus revealed that Mia is actually an undercover police officer. She hands Raizor to the arriving police, but before they arrive, she throws the BMW keys to the protagonist. Cross sends all the Rockport Police Force (Level 6 Police) to chase him. It is impossible to hide in usual shelters, since the police controlled all the safe places of the street racers. After five minutes of pursuit, Mia calls to inform her that the only way to get away from the pursuit is to drive along the initially closed road and, after accelerating, fly over the unfinished bridge and get out of the city.</p>
