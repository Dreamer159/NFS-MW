			<h1>Game development</h1>
			<p>Even though no game has been announced yet, Electronic Arts registered the domain name www.needforspeedmostwanted.com in 2004. According to rumors, work was underway on a new part of the Need for Speed ​​series. Later, on April 11, 2005, information about the game was published, according to which the new game will be subtitled Most Wanted. According to the developers, Need for Speed: Most Wanted will feature extensive car tuning options, city street races, and police pursuits that were absent in Underground and Underground 2. From the known information, it was also announced that the new game will be released on a large number of games. platforms: Xbox, PlayStation 2, GameCube, PlayStation Portable, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, personal computers, as well as on the next generation console - Xbox 360. This decision was made because the developers wanted to make the project accessible to a large gaming audience by introducing various innovations. In addition, Need for Speed: Most Wanted was the first game in the series to feature video footage with real-life actors. According to the developers, this was intended to make the game more cinematic. Subsequently, the videos with the actors were filmed for the next games in the series.</p>
			<p>On May 19, 2005, the game was announced, when a preview with a description of the new part was published on the Future Gamez portal. Need for Speed: Most Wanted was unveiled to the public on May 22nd at the annual E3 2005 gaming show where the first trailer was shown [23] [24] and a limited demo version of the game for the Xbox 360 console was shown at the Electronic Arts booth. [25] ... The version for this console used better graphics effects, sharper textures, lighting and motion blur than in versions of the game for other platforms, as well as support for HDDR technology. In addition, the versions for the Xbox 360, Xbox, PlayStation 2 and GameCube consoles included support for widescreen resolution. The game was developed by the Canadian development team EA Canada in conjunction with EA Black Box, which has been leading one of Electronic Arts' flagship brand series, Need for Speed, since joining EA Canada. Therefore, Most Wanted combines the ideas of the classic parts of the series, such as racing in expensive sports cars and police pursuits with street racing and car tuning. According to the information known from the developers, the graphics in the game are based on the EA Graphics Library (EAGL4) engine, which was also used in the previous parts of the series. The developers also implemented a dynamic change of weather conditions during the game, as in the previous project of the series - Underground 2.</p>
			<p>Like previous games in the series, Need for Speed: Most Wanted has the ability to multiplayer over the Internet. In versions of the game for consoles, Xbox 360 and for personal computers, the developers have provided a mode of play over the network. Also, the online game mode was planned for the PlayStation 2 game console, but in the end it had to be abandoned. According to the developers, this is due to the busy schedule of work on the creation of a multiplayer version of the game and the lack of time to check online components in general, although the version for the PlayStation Portable also has the ability to play over the network. Previously, the previous games in the series - Need for Speed: Underground and Need for Speed: Underground 2 on the PlayStation 2 console provided multiplayer online. In beta tests on the PlayStation 2, the multiplayer mode is present, and in addition, the beta version has some differences from the final one in terms of visual style and gameplay, as well as the presence of some cars that are cut in the final version (however, in the game files you can find folders with these machines). In addition, the Horn, which in the final version is the player's assistant, in the beta version is # 16 on the Blacklist, which the player must first win in the race.</p>
			<p>On August 5, 2005, Electronic Arts announced the release date for Need for Speed: Most Wanted. According to preliminary information, the game will be released on November 15 in North America and November 25 in European countries on the PlayStation Portable, GameCube, Xbox, PlayStation 2, Nintendo DS and personal computers. On October 7, Electronic Arts launched a portal on its Need for Speed: Most Wanted site, which contains known game information, screenshots, wallpapers and more. There were initially rumors among the gaming community that more than a hundred cars would be presented in Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but this information was later denied.

On October 26, it became known that a demo version of Need for Speed: Most Wanted for personal computers would be released early next month, but no details were given.
