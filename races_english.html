			<h1>Races</h1>
			<p>Need for Speed: Most Wanted features a variety of race types familiar from previous games in the series, as well as brand new ones [13]. However, unlike the two previous installments in the series, Underground and Underground 2, the game lacks Drifting. Also, races now take place only on the territory of the city, and there are no races on individual tracks in the game.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>"Ring" (English Circuit) is a race on a closed circuit. The player's goal is to drive a few laps and cross the finish line first. Throughout the race, a counter of lap statistics and place in the championship list is kept. The number of laps to be driven varies from map to map and ranges from two to five. It is not uncommon for these types of racing tracks to have many turns and require the player to tune the car for sensitive control and fast acceleration.</p></li>
				<li><p>Sprint is a type of race on a given segment from one point on the map to another. The track of this type of race is not closed. The player's goal is to drive the track and finish first. During the race, statistics of progress on the track in percentage and the place occupied by the player in the championship list are kept. Races of this type most often run on highways and require from the player not so much control as speed.</p></li>
				<li><p>“Stopwatch” (English TollBooth), similar to “Sprint”, represents an open track. The main difference from the "Sprint" is in the presence of control points placed on the track. In addition, only the player can participate in this type of race. A certain time is allotted for the passage of each checkpoint. The player's goal is to pass all the checkpoints in the specified time. When driving through a section with a control point on the map, the remaining time is added to the time allotted for the next point (the finish line is also a control point). If the player does not have time to reach the point within the specified time, the entire race is considered lost. During the race, statistics of progress along the track, the number of points and the remaining time are kept. This type of race was not present in the previous game in the series.</p></li>
				<li><p>Lap Knockout is similar to Ring Knockout, except that the last rider completes the lap and is eliminated from the game. Thus, the player's goal in this race is not to complete all laps last, but the final lap first. The number of riders in this competition, as well as in - is four, as a result of which there are always three circles. In this type of race, there is almost no police (it is present in such races only when Bull and Raizor from the Black List have passed).</p></li>
				<li><p>"Fighter" (English Speedtrap) - a type of race on an open track, similar to the "Sprint" and "Stopwatch". Radars are placed along the entire route - checkpoints, in which the speed of passing cars is recorded. The player's goal is to drive through these points as fast as possible. The speeds for each player add up. The winner is not the one who crosses the finish line first, but the player with the maximum number of speed points. However, after the completion of the race by one of the participants, all the others begin to deduct speed points, which gives a slight advantage to the first one to complete. Throughout the entire route, statistics of radars, total speed and percentage of progress along the route are kept. This type of race was not present in the previous game in the series.</p></li>
				<li><p>Drag racing is a type of race in which the player must cross the finish line first, optimally changing gears. Unlike other types of racing, the steering is carried out only with the help of a manual transmission. In addition, in this type of race, the player maneuvers along strictly defined lanes of the track, rebuilding from row to row. Almost any collision with an obstacle or vehicle will end the race and lose. You can also overheat the engine (if you hold the tachometer needle in the red zone for a long time) and leave the race. Championship statistics are kept during the game. This is the only mode where civilian traffic is strictly scripted. It is also the only type of race where there is no police at all.</p></li>
				<h1>Chase</h1>
				<p>After a break in the series, the police returned again. If the player violates the speed limit in the race with the maximum probability of the appearance of the police or in the free ride mode, police patrols appear in the area. The game enters chase mode when the player stumbles upon such a patrol (with the camera showing the car that spotted him). The player needs to break away from the police, hide, waiting for the end of the chase. The main parameter of the chase is the status (English heat level). There are seven of them in the game, six of which are present in the "Career" mode. As the level rises, different police units are involved in the pursuit, their tactical arsenal expands [14]. On the fifth and sixth levels of the chase, Sergeant Cross joins the pursuers, the characteristic coloring of the car which distinguishes him from other policemen. All achievements and ratings obtained during police pursuits, for example, the number of disabled police cars and bypassed road blocks, are recorded in the "Dossier", which becomes available after completing the first few races of the "Career" mode. In it, the player can view and compare his results with other riders on the Black List.</p>
				<p>For breaking police cars, the player receives an additional rating. Different police vehicles are more or less prone to damage. For example, jeeps are harder to disable than other police cars. Road blocks on wide roads often have a gap on one or both sides. Sometimes there may be "bumps", spikes or roadblocks with a "STOP" sign. If the car hits the spiked belt, the tires will puncture, which will lead to the loss of the possibility of further movement. In addition, if the player's speed is less than 20 km / h and a police car is nearby, the indicator at the bottom of the screen begins to shift to the “arrest” section. Upon reaching this division, the pursuit ends with the arrest of the player. If this happens in Career Mode, then the player is subject to a penalty and a warning about a possible vehicle confiscation. The amount of the fine depends on the violation and the damage caused. If the player cannot pay the fine or the number of warnings reaches the maximum, his car will be confiscated (however, after a while the confiscated car can be redeemed for money or for a token), and if the player's last car is confiscated, the game ends and starts from the moment when the last car was left. Also, in the career mode, a different level of pursuit is set for each player's car. It can be reduced by changing the appearance of the car (body kit, painting) or if you do not catch the eyes of the police for a while.</p>
				<p>If the player escapes from the police, the chase goes into standby mode. A gradually filling indicator appears - when it is full, the chase stops. The area where the player was last seen is under heavy police patrol. In this mode, “shelters” appear (white circles on the map, highlighted by a dotted line), where you can significantly speed up the filling of the indicator, as well as hide from the helicopter, the appearance of which is also possible during the pursuit, starting from the fourth status of the chase. If the player is noticed by the police before the indicator is full, the chase returns to active mode. The helicopter has a limited fuel supply, so sometimes it will fly off for refueling. In the active chase mode, "chase breakers" appear on the map - large but fragile structures that can be brought down on the pursuers and incapacitated [15]. Over time, these structures are restored, and they can again be brought down on the police.</p>
